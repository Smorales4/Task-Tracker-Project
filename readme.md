 Aspirations for the project
In order to learn new topics and methods to create an application with API access, I have done this project. I value the time dedicated by my instructors and mentors, and thanks to them, I have been able to complete it. 

My expectations
I hope this can help me as a professional experience and as a fundamental learning base.  

Functions of this application
Through it, you will be able to create an item to compare to have it in a list. Local Storage will be used to store the information. 

Areas of opportunity
I consider that I need to improve my understanding of the APIs, studying them a little more to be able to make better connections in the future.
